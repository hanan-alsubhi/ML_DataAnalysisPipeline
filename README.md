#  Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning
This project builds a complete pipeline to predict diabetes using machine learning. It includes data cleaning, feature engineering, numerical analysis, and model development using Python libraries: **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Scikit-learn**.

##  Project Structure

- **Phase 1 – Data Exploration & Cleaning (Pandas)**
  - Load and inspect the dataset
  - Handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers
  - Visualize distributions and correlations
  - Create new features (e.g., BMI-Age trend)

- **Phase 2 – Numerical Computation (NumPy)**
  - Perform vectorized operations
  - Apply custom math functions (e.g., matrix determinant, norms)
  - Compare results with NumPy built-in methods

- **Phase 3 – Model Building (Scikit-learn)**
  - Train models: Naive Bayes & Random Forest
  - Evaluate using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
  - Use cross-validation and grid search for tuning
